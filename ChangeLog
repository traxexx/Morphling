Add simplification level:
	0: No simplification
	1: Only process regions with disc/unmap
	2: Only process regions with MEI disc (from checking map coordinate)

Accordingly:
	pre-process disc when doing take chr out
	generate a candidate.bed for regions
	index output disc.sam if single chr
	use TakeChrOut to print related-records
	(then do nsort as old version does)
